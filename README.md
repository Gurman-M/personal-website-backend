# Cloud Resume Site

This project aims to host my personal website on AWS. The idea for this project is based off the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). The goal was to build and deploy a resume website using real cloud services â€” while learning about CI/CD, infrastructure as code, serverless functions, and more.

NOTE: All infrastructure related to this project has been deleted and the AWS account has been closed. This code is for educational/demo purposes only.
